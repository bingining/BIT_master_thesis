% 这是北京理工大学硕士研究生毕业论文的模板。
% 参考资料：北京理工大学博士、硕士学位论文撰写规范
% 具体规范见：http://www.bitme.com.cn/peiyang/2009-11-13/170.html
%
% 本模板在以下环境已测试可以编译通过：
% 操作系统：linux（ubuntu和archlinux）
% 文本编辑器：Texmaker
% LaTex编译选项：XeLaTex（必须用XeTex）
%
% 本模板最初由大眼小蚂蚁根据交大的模板修改得到，参见：
% https://code.google.com/p/bit-master-thesis-latex/
%
% 此版本由bingining做了大幅度改动，使得与学校所给的Word模板更一致。

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 导言 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[twoside]{BitMasterThesis}
% twoside对应双面排版；如需单面排版，请用oneside选项；
% 请尽量使用twoside选项，因为学校的规范里面明确要求应该双面打印：
%	"论文稿件要求使用A4纸双面打印，其中摘要之前部分使用单页打印。"
% 另外oneside选项没经过调试，可能会存在问题。
% 其余的设置在BitMasterThesis.cls里头，已使用学校规定的设置，无需更改。


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 宏包调用 %
% 原来的宏包调用都是写在bitmaster-xetex.cls里的。
% 经过修改后，% 除了一些必须的且无需更改的宏包仍留在bitmaster-xetex.cfg里面
% （包括：natbib，hyperref，geometry，setspace，titletoc，ifthen，
%		fancyhdr，fontspec，xltxtra，fontenc，mathptmx，ccaption）之外，
%	其余的宏包调用都需要在这个主文档里写明（例如处理公式、表格和图标等的宏包）。
